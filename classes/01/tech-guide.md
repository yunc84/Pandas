## A NOTE ABOUT TECHNOLOGY
Follow the guidelines below to ensure your machine is fully prepared for Data Science: 

#### System Requirements
Make sure your machine is running with administrator permissions and has **at least 10+ GB of free disk space**. We also recommend that you use a laptop with a **13-inch screen or larger** in order to do your best work. In our experience, *students with an 11-inch screen have a harder time in class*.

#### Mac Users
General Assembly is a Mac-friendly organization.  Our instructors will be teaching the course using Macs, so we strongly recommend students use a Mac with OS X 10.11 (“El Capitan”) in order to run all of the programs necessary for the course. **This rules out some older MacBooks.**

Check the following specs to make sure your machine can provide you with the performance you’ll need in this course:

* *1.6GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor*
* *Turbo Boost up to 2.7GHz*
* *Intel HD Graphics 6000*
* *At least 8GB RAM*
* *128GB flash storage*
* *10+ GB of free disk space*

#### PC Users
While you can be a data scientist with *any* machine, some students have found compatibility issues with older versions of Windows. While you can be a data scientist with any machine, unfortunately, there are a number of compatibility issues with Python libraries and older versions of Windows. For example, Python and Anaconda users have identified multiple issues with Windows 7 x64 machines. 

Therefore, we **strongly recommend** that PCs users adopt the latest version of Windows** (“Windows 10”). PC users on older machines may consider installing a Virtual Machine like [Oracle’s Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and running Anaconda in a Linux environment via [Ubuntu Desktop](http://www.ubuntu.com/download). [See more information here](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/images).

Please note that our instructors will be conducting the course using Macs, and *may not be able to help PC or Linux users troubleshoot* any issues you might encounter. ***If you choose to use a PC or Linux machine, you will need to provide your own IT support.***
