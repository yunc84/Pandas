- [logarithms](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/exponential-and-logarithmic-functions/introduction-to-logarithms/v/logarithms)
- [e](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/alg-exp-and-log/alg-e-and-the-natural-logarithm/v/e-through-compound-interest)
- [odds](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/probability-geometry/probability-basics/v/basic-probability)
